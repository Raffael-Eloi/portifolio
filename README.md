## Purpose

The aim of this project was to familiarize myself with Angular's syntax, components, and overall structure. <br> 
Additionally, it provided an opportunity to practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) with Angular, leveraging various libraries to enhance my skill set. <br>
I also implemented a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline the development process.

## Versions

| Technology | Version |
|------------|---------|
| Angular    | 18.0.2  |
| Node       | 20.0.2  |

## Concepts Used

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Applied for designing and developing the application.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensured separation of concerns within the application and its components.
- **Atomic Design**: Adopted for organizing and structuring the project efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.

## How to Run the project

1. Run `ng serve` for a development server.
2. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any source files.

## Running Unit Tests
