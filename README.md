This project is my personal portfolio, showcasing my professional experience, skills, projects, and education history. It also includes some personal interests and hobbies.

## Purpose ✅
The purpose of this project was to:

- Get hands-on experience with Angular's syntax, components, and architecture.
- Practice Test-Driven Development (TDD) using Angular and various testing libraries.
- Implement a Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline to streamline the development process.

## Concepts Used 💥

- **Test-Driven Development (TDD)**: Applied for designing and developing the application.
- **SOLID Principles**: Ensured separation of concerns within the application and its components.
- **Atomic Design**: Adopted for organizing and structuring the project efficiently.
- **CI/CD Pipeline**: Integrated to automate testing, building, and deployment processes.
